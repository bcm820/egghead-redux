/* REDUX PRINCIPLES:
1. STATE: An application's entire state is represented by a single, immutable state tree contained within a single, plain object.
State can only be updated by dispatching actions...
2. DISPATCHING ACTION: An action is a plain object that represents the update being made to the state tree.
Its structure requires a serializable "type" property as well as customizable properties and values representing changes to the data.
3. REDUCER: A reducer function is a PURE FUNCTION that takes only two inputs:
(1) Your application's state, and
(2) the action being dispatched.
It then returns the next state of your application, mapped as a brand new object (not a modified version of the state).
Note: A pure function returns a value that relies solely on the values of arguments passed in, without any side effects derived from server/DB calls.
This way the output is predictable. Also, a pure function does not update and return existing data. Rather, it returns brand new data.
